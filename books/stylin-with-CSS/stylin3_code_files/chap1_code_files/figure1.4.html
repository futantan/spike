	<h1>Types of Guitars</h1>
	<p>Guitars come in two main types: electric and acoustic.</p>
	<h2>Acoustic Guitars</h2>
	<p>Acoustic guitars have a large hollow body that projects the sound of the strings.</p>
	<h3>Nylon String Acoustic Guitars</h3>
	<p>Descendants of the gut-strung instruments of yore, nylon string guitars have a mellow tone.</p>
	<h3>Steel String Acoustic Guitars</h3>
	<p>Steel string guitars first appeared in country music and today most acoustic guitars have steel strings.</p>
	<h2>Electric Guitars</h2>
	<p>Electric guitars have a solid or hollow body with pickups that capture the string vibration so it can be amplified.</p>
	<h3>Solid Body Electric Guitars</h3>
	<p>Solid body electric guitars are commonly used in rock and country music.</p>
	<h3>Hollow Body Electric Guitars</h3>
	<p>Hollow body acoustic guitars are commonly used in blues and jazz.</p>
