<body>
    <p>Here is a paragraph of text with default line height. Line height is the vertical
      distance between the baseline of one line of type and the next. This distance
      is a proportion of the font-size.</p>
    <p class="tight">The default line spacing is typically 1.2, but this paragraph
      has a tighter setting of .8, meaning the descenders of one line will touch
      the ascenders of the one below if they appear above one another.</p>
    <!--end footer-->
    <p class="loose">This paragraph has a looser setting of 1.5. The font-size is 12 pixels
      and the line-height is 1.5 so the distance between the lines is 18 pixels. This gives an elegant
      look to your typography, but is a less efficient use of the vertical space.</p>
